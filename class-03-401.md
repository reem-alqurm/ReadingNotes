# -Review, Research, and Discussion
### - Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware
- Authentication (Auth middleware)
- Error Handling (Error Handing Middleware)
- Logging-in (Logging Middleware)

### - True or false: The route handler is middleware?

* The route handler is middleware.
### - In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?
* Sending an error message by passing a string to next`("string")`
* without writing `next()`. 
### At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?
* Between in the middle of the request and the response .
### What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”
* When a server tries to send several responses for one request.
# Vocabulary Terms
## Middleware :
* are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. 
## Request Object :
* Request is used to describe an request to a server.
## Response Object :
* The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
## Application Middleware :
* a middleware that works on application level like authentication .
## Routing Middleware :
* a middleware that works on router level.
## Test Driven Development :
* is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do (the specifications), formulating a failing test, then writing the code to make that test pass. 
## Behavioral Testing :
* focused on the behaviour of users rather than the technical functions of the software.

# Classes
* Functions in JavaScript that create a template code that makes the code more readable and easy to use.
 * Classes must be declared before used.
# Express Routing
* refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.
* Routes is declered as follow:
`app.HTTP_method(Path, handler Function);`
* To specify a middleware as the callback function we use :
`app.use()`
