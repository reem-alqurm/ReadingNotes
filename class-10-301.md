# The Call Stack and Debugging

## The Call Stack

* A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function .

* a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).
* Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.
* When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.

* Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
* When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
* If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.


* In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.

* Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is **synchronous**.
* When a function is invoked (called), the function, its parameters, and variables are pushed into the call stack to form a **stack frame**. This stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The memory is cleared when the function returns as it is pop out of the stack.

## Errors

### Reference errors
* This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
* when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, is called **Temporal Dead Zone**.
### Syntax errors
* This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

### Range errors
* when you try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

### Type errors
* This types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.
## Debugging

* The easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply `console.log()` the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press `cmd+o` in macOS or `Ctrl+o` in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (`F5`).
* The breakpoint can also be achieved by putting a debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.
* Using Node.js with Visual Studio Code you can press the debug tab and add a configuration You can run the debugger by pressing `F5` or pressing the green play button.
### Handling errors
* we usually `try` to `catch` the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).
### Tools to avoid runtime errors
you can use tools like:
* quokka to evaluate your code as you type.
* eslint to make sure your style guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way.
* You can check out stuff like TypeScript.
