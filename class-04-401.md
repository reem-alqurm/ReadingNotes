# Review, Research, and Discussion
### - Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
- Better program design and higher code quality.
- Reduces the time required for project development.
- Code flexibility and easier maintenance.

### - In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

* when a method needs to be run before a test and another method  run after it. 
### - What is one downside of Test Driven Development ?

* if the developer leaves or forgets the reason that the test returns one specific value and not some other. 
### - Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

* ES6 Classes are syntactical sugar so it is much easier to implement.

### - Why REST?
1) REST is Easy to Understand and Implement.
2) REST Makes your Application More Scalable.
3) Caching is Easier with REST.
4) REST is Flexibile.

## object-oriented programming (OOP) :
* It is the ability of creating different objects from a common object.
## class :
* Classes are a template for creating objects.
## `super` and `this` :
* `super` a keyword to call the super constructor .
* `this`a keyword to define properties inside the `{}`
## Test Driven Development (TDD) :
* is the act of first deciding what you want your program to do (the specifications), formulating a failing test, then writing the code to make that test pass. 
## Jest :
* Is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. 
## Continuous Integration (CI) :
* Is a pattern of programming combining testing, safety checks, and development practices to confidently push code from a development branch to production ready branch continuously.

## REST
* Stands for REpresentational State Transfer, it is web standards based architecture and uses HTTP Protocol.
