## What is SQL?

* SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

## Relational databases

* represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.
* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write SELECT statements, which are often colloquially refered to as queries.
* A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
* The result of a query will be a two-dimensional set of rows and columns, effectively a copy of the table, but only with the columns that we requested.

* If we want to retrieve absolutely all the columns of data from a table, we can then use the asterisk (*) shorthand in place of listing all the column names individually.
* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a `WHERE` clause in the query.
* More complex clauses can be constructed by joining numerous `AND` or `OR` logical keywords (ie. num_wheels >= 4 AND doors <= 2).
* When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching.
* SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the `DISTINCT` keyword.

* SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the `ORDER BY` clause.
* When an `ORDER BY` clause is specified, each row is sorted alpha-numerically based on the specified column's value. 
* Another clause which is commonly used with the `ORDER BY` clause are the `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about.

## What is a Schema?
* the database schema is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.
* When inserting data into a database, we need to use an `INSERT` statement, which declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling, and one or more rows of data to insert.

* In addition to adding new data, a common task is to update existing data, which can be done using an UPDATE statement.


* When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a DELETE statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.
* you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement.

*using the ALTER TABLE statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

* If you need to rename the table itself, you can also do that using the RENAME TO clause of the statement.

*  you can use the DROP TABLE statement, which differs from the DELETE statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.
