## Domain Modeling

* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
* A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
*  An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
* It defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.

A domain

- Learning a new technology
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable

* We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the problem domain.

* many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
* you should take the time to clearly understand the problem domain before writing any code.
* You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.


## Objects 

* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

## DOM:

* Document Object Model (DOM) :

- The Document Object Model DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how javaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

- As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called **a DOM tree**, and it is stored in the browsersâ€™ memory. It consists of four main types of nodes:

* the document node :Every element, attribute, and piece of text in the HTML is represented by its own DOM node.

* Attribute nodes: are not children of the element that carries them; they are part of that element. 

* Text nodes cannot have children. If an element contains text and another child element, the child element is not a child of the text node but rather a child of the containing element.
