# Links & Layout

## Links 

* Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from
one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

* Links are created using the `<a>` element. Users can click on anything
between the opening `<a>` tag and the closing `</a>` tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

* Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.

* If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening `<a>` tag. The value of this
attribute should be *_blank*.

* To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the `<a>`element again, but the value of
the href attribute starts with the *#* symbol, followed by the
value of the id attribute of the element you want to link to. 


## Layout 

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
 This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
* CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning.
* To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use
box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom
and left or right it should be placed. (You will meet these when we
introduce the positioning schemes on the following pages.
* The z-index property allows you to control which box appears
on top.
* Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show
different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to
work on a range of different sized screens.
* Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some
devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most
operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
