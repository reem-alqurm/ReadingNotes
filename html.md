* a web browser: A software people ueses to access websites for examples Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,Chrome, and Opera.

* Web Servers: When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.

technologies into the mix.
