#  AWS: S3 and Lambda
## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Describe “The Cloud”
  * refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

* What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
 * unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies.


* What is auto-scaling?
  * lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. 



* What is bandwidth?
  *  is a measure of how much information a network can transfer. 

* How do cloud providers compute service costs?
  * cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud.

* is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).

*  Lambda create functions, self-contained applications written in one of the supported languages and runtimes, and upload them to AWS Lambda, which executes those functions in an efficient and flexible manner.

* **serverless** computing refers to not needing to maintain your own servers to run these functions.
* Use mostly Node JS and Python.
* Lambda is a fully managed service that takes care of all the infrastructure .

* Lambda function runs in its own container.

*  The entire infrastructure layer of AWS Lambda is managed by AWS.

* since the service is fully managed, using AWS Lambda can save you time on operational tasks.
