# the difference between PUT and PATCH


* The main difference between the `PUT` and `PATCH` method is that the `PUT` method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the `PATCH` method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource.
* `PATCH` applies a partial update to the resource.

# Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
* SOAP is a standardized protocol that sends messages using other protocols such as HTTP .

* As opposed to SOAP, REST is not a protocol but an architectural style. The REST architecture lays down a set of guidelines you need to follow if you want to provide a RESTful web service.

* As SOAP is an official protocol, it comes with strict rules and advanced security features such as built-in ACID compliance and authorization.
