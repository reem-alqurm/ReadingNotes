## What is a Stack
* A stack is a data structure that consists of `Nodes`. Each `Node` references the `next` Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

* `Push` - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* `Pop` - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* `Top` - This is the top of the stack.
* `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* `IsEmpty` - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## Stacks follow these concepts:

* `FILO` : First In Last Out
* This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* `LIFO`: Last In First Out. 
* This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.



## Stack Visualization
* as below the top is the first node in the stack and when you `pop` you `pop` the current `top` and set the next `top` as `top.next`.

## What is a Queue

* what you need to know for queue :

* `Enqueue` - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* `Dequeue` - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* `Front` - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* `Rear` - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* `Peek` - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* `IsEmpty` - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

* Queues follow these concepts:

* `FIFO` : First In First Out
* This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

* `LILO` :Last In Last Out
* This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

## Queues Visualization
* as below is how the queues is strcutured.
