## A simple set of steps
* simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem.

  - Read the problem completely twice.
  - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
  - Optimize the manual steps.
  - Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
  - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
  - Optimize the real code.

## Time Mangement

* If you don’t treat yourself and your time with respect, you will become unhappy, resentful, and tired. Your body and mind long for mastery and freedom; you can’t have those things if your time is cheap and easily taken.

 * *As you think, so you are.*
 * Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that, too.
 * *“The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.”* -Warren Buffet

## The 5 Whys

* The method is remarkably simple: when a problem occurs, you drill down to its root cause by asking "Why?" five times. Then, when a counter-measure becomes apparent, you follow it through to prevent the issue from recurring.
* The 5 Whys uses "counter-measures," rather than "solutions." A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising again, while a solution may just seek to deal with the symptom. As such, counter-measures are more robust, and will more likely prevent the problem from recurring. 
* You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.
