# Node . JS
 

* Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

* Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
* `The V8 engine` is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi.
*  It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
*  Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

- Node.js, however, is single-threaded. 
- t’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

* Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites.
* It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database) .

* It can be used as a scripting language to automate repetitive or error prone tasks on your PC. .
* Node.js can also can be used to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
