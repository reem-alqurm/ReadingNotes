## Domain Modeling


* Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
* A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
*  An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
* It defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams.


- Learning a new technology
- Naming things
- Testing your code
- Debugging
- Fixing bugs
- Making software maintainable

* We put together code with the purpose of building components that we have taken out of the problem domain.

* many problem domains are like a puzzle with a blurry picture or no picture at all.
* you should take the time to clearly understand the problem domain before writing any code.
* You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.


## Tables 

* A table represents information in a grid format.

* The `< table>` element is used to add tables to a web page.
* A table contans a set of colomns and rows 
* `<tr>` used to create new row `<td>` used to fill the data in. 
* `<th>` used to make header .


## Functions, Methods, and Objects: 

* Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. 
* An object is a series of variables (**properties**) and functions (**methods**).

* Creating an object: constructor nation The new keyword and the object constructor create a blank object.
* To update the value of properties, use dot nation or sequare brackets. `object.name='value`'


* Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex datasets (and both can contain the other).
