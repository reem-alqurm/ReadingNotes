#  Event Driven Applications
## Review, Research, and Discussion
* Why is access control important?
  * Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems.

* Describe an application that would need access control.
 * Login credentials (such as usernames and passwords). PINs and one-time passwords (OTPs). Virtual private network (VPN) access to internal networks.
  

* What is a role used for?
  *  define who can access what and do what.


* Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
  * Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositories.
  * Use environment variables.
  * Use "Secrets as a service" solutions.

## Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

* Node.js uses events heavily and it is also one of the reasons why Node.js is pretty fast compared to other similar technologies.
* As soon as Node starts its server, it simply initiates its variables, declares functions and then simply waits for the event to occur.

* In an event-driven application, there is generally a main loop that listens for events, and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected.

* Although events look quite similar to callbacks, the difference lies in the fact that callback functions are called when an `asynchronous` function returns its result, whereas event handling works on the `observer pattern`.

* The functions that listen to events act as `Observers`.

* Following is the syntax to bind an event handler with an event :

``// Bind event and event  handler as follows
eventEmitter.on('eventName', eventHandler);
``

* We can fire an event programmatically as follows :

``// Fire an event 
eventEmitter.emit('eventName');``
