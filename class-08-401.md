# Access Control (ACL)
## Review, Research, and Discussion
* When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? 
  * The Basic authentication schemes are dedicated to the authentication using a username and a secret.

  * The Bearer authentication scheme is dedicated to the authentication using a token even if this scheme comes from an OAuth2 specification, you can still use it in any other context where tokens are exchange between a client and a server.
  

* What does the JSON Web Token package do?
  *  used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature.


* What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
  * Use encryption to store secrets within .git repositories.
  * Use environment variables.
  * Use "Secrets as a service" solutions.

## Vocabulary Terms

### encryption :
*  securing data by encoding it mathematically . 
### token :
* 	is a  secure format used to transmit sensitive information between two services .
### bearer :
*  is an HTTP authentication scheme originally created as part of OAuth 2.0, but is now used on its own.
### secret :
* a key that is added when generating the token as part of it to scure it more.

### JSON Web Token :
* A token used for authentication, consists of a header, a payload and a signature. 


## RBAC

*  Is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.
* Can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).
* a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.

* Three primary rules are defined for RBAC:

  * Role assignment: A subject can exercise a permission only if the subject has selected or been assigned a role.
  * Role authorization: A subject's active role must be authorized for the subject. With rule 1 above, this rule ensures that users can take on only roles for which they are authorized.
  * Permission authorization: A subject can exercise a permission only if the permission is authorized for the subject's active role. With rules 1 and 2, this rule ensures that users can exercise only permissions for which they are authorized.

### When defining an RBAC model, the following conventions are useful:

  * S = Subject = A person or automated agent
  * R = Role = Job function or title which defines an authority level
  * P = Permissions = An approval of a mode of access to a resource
  * SE = Session = A mapping involving S, R and/or P
  * SA = Subject Assignment
  * PA = Permission Assignment
  * RH = Partially ordered Role Hierarchy. RH can also be written: ≥ (The notation: x ≥ y means that x inherits the permissions of y.)
     * A subject can have multiple roles.
     * A role can have multiple subjects.
     * A role can have many permissions.
     * A permission can be assigned to many roles.
     * An operation can be assigned to many permissions.
     * A permission can be assigned to many operations.

### Comparing with ACL
* RBAC differs from access control lists (ACLs), used in traditional discretionary access-control systems, in that RBAC systems assign permissions to specific operations with meaning in the organization, rather than to low-level data objects.
