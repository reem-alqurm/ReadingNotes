## What is a Hashtable?

* **Hash** - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. it is used to determine the index of the array.

* **Buckets** - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.

* **Collisions** - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

* **Hashtables** are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every **Node** or **Bucket** has both a key, and a value.

* Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity.
* Hash function takes a key and returns an integer, use the integer to determine where the key/value pair should be placed in the array (hash code).
* The hash code is used again to read something from the hash map.
* Take the key, run it through the hash code to get a number, use that number to index the array

## Creating a Hash
* Hashtable traditionally is created from an array.
* After you've created your array, do some sort of logic to turn that "key" into a numeric number value (example: Add or multiply all the ASCII values together, Multiply it by a prime number such as 599, Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array, Insert into the array at that index)
* Each index of the array can hold many types of values.
* Each index of the array contain “buckets”, and each of these “buckets” holds one key/value pair combination.
* When there is no entry in a specific bucket, the buckets (each index of the array) all start null
* The hash table starts each bucket empty and overwrites their value once a key generates a hash code that corresponds with an index.
## Collisions
* Collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array.
* Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets.
* Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one.
* Now if two keys resolve to the same index in the array then their key/value pairs can be stored as a node in a linked list.
* Since different keys can lead to the same bucket it’s important to store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, not just the value.
## To Store Values
* Hash maps to this to store values:
  * accept a key.
  * calculate the hash of the key.
  * use modulus to convert the hash into an array index.
  * store the key with the value by appending both to the end of a linked list.

## To Read Values
* Hash maps do this to read value:
  * accept a key
  * calculate the hash of the key
  * use modulus to convert the hash into an array index
  * use the array index to access the short LinkedList representing a bucket
  * search through the bucket looking for a node with a key/value pair that matches the key you were given
