# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

## Review, Research, and Discussion


* How granular should your reducers be?
     *  It is difficult to manage states that are deeply nested, so more reducers is better than only a few. Redux gives us combineReducers to let us define more precisely what our initial state will look like.

* Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
   *  Not sure, I would guess con as it gets messy and actions need to get filtered through.

* Name a strategy for preventing the above?
  * Using Redux middleware thunk, allows for evaluating the actions.



## Vocabulary Terms

### store :
  * Holds the whole state tree of the application, only way to change the state inside is to dispatch an action on it.
### combined reducers : 
  * Helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore.

* Redux Thunk Middleware:
  * Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object.
  * That function receives the store's dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function's body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.
  * allows for delayed actions, including working with promises. One of the main use cases for this middleware is for handling actions that might not be synchronous.
