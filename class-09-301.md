* Functional programming is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data .

* pure functions is :
  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic).
  - It does not cause any observable side effects.

* If our function reads external files, it’s not a pure function .

* Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable.

* Pure functions benefits is that the code’s definitely easier to test. 

* Functions as first-class entities can:
  - refer to it from constants and variables.
  - pass it as a parameter to other functions.
  - return it as result from other functions.

* Higher-order functions:
  - When we talk about higher-order functions, we mean a function that either:
     - takes one or more functions as arguments, or
     - returns a function as its result

* The doubleOperator function we implemented above is a higher-order function because it takes an operator function as an argument and uses it.
* Map : The idea of map is to transform a collection.
* The map method transforms a collection by applying a function to all of its elements and building a new collection from the returned values.

* Filter: Given a collection, we want to filter by an attribute.
* The filter function expects a true or false value to determine if the element should or should not be included in the result collection.
