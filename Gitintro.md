## What is a Git?

let us first go throw some important concept.

## Version Control
is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

### There are three types of version control :

#### 1- Local Version Control :
A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

#### 2- Centralized Version Control :
This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.


#### 3- Distributed Version Control :
Allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

## So, what is Git? 
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project called **commit** Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.
Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources.

### Three typs of States for Git :
committed, modified and staged.
