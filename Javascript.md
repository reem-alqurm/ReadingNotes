## What is a Script and how i can creat one?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

## How to write a script :

* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 
* Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 

### Steps tp write a script :
* DEFINE THE GOAL : First, you need to define the task you want to
achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve. 

* DESIGN THE SCRIPT : To design a script you split the goal out into a series
of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzl using a flowchart. 

* CODE EACH STEP : Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. 
## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES 

Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name: 
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start
with a number.
* The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you
must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
* All variables are case sensitive .
* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
* If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. 


## Arrays
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn'tq just store one value; it stores a list of values.  

* You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable (using the var keyword followed by the name of
the array).
* Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
