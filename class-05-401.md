# Linked Lists
## What is a linked list?
* A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements. A data element can be represented as a node in a linked list.
* Each node consists of two parts: data & pointer to the next node.
* nodes are linked using pointers.

## A linked list has the following properties:
* Successive nodes are connected by pointers.
* The last node points to null.
* A head pointer is maintained which points to the first node of the list.
* A linked list can grow and shrink in size during execution of the program.
* It can be made just as long as required.
* It allocates memory as the list grows..

## advantage of a linked list
* In contrast to an array, which stores data contiguously in memory, a linked list can easily insert or remove nodes from the list without reorganization of the entire data structure.

## Types of Linked lists
There are a few different types of linked lists. But the most popular ones are: singly, doubly and circular.

*  We depend on the `Next` value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing.
* The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a `while()` loop.
