## Form Structure
* Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. This element should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
* the action Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the
information in the form when it is submitted.
* the method Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
* The `<input>` element is used to create several different form controls.
* The value of the `type` attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating. 
`type="text"`When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.
* `name` When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which form control each 
piece of data was entered into.

* HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms.
