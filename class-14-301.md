*  is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. 
* By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database.

## Reasons for Database Normalization
- To minimize duplicate data.
-  to minimize or avoid data modification issues.
- to simplify queries. 
## Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
* Duplicated information presents two problems:

- It increases storage and decrease performance.
- It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.

* Database normalization fixes the situations are modification anomalies. 

* There are three modification anomalies that can occur:
### Insert Anomaly
* There are facts we cannot record until we know information for the entire row. so in order to create the record, we need provide a primary key. 

### Update Anomaly
* In this case we have the same information in several rows. If we don’t update all rows, then inconsistencies appear.

### Deletion Anomaly
* Deletion of a row causes removal of more than one set of facts.

## Search and Sort Issues
* You can eliminate or reduce the issues of sorting and searching anomalies by separating the data into different tables. This puts the data into tables serving a single purpose.

* The process to redesign the table is database normalization.

## Definition of Database Normalization
* There are three common forms of database normalization: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd normal form. They are also abbreviated as 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF respectively. 

* The forms are progressive, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form.

* **First Normal Form** – The information is stored in a relational table with each column containing atomic values. There are no repeating groups of columns.
* **Second Normal Form** – The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the table’s primary key.
* **Third Normal Form** – the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key
