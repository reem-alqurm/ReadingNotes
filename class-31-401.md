# Hooks API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
  * react-router-dom allows to register multiple URLs and their corresponding components in one of the parent nodes of the DOM tree. Then, depending on the URL entered certain nodes are rendered to the DOM and others are not. Single-page-applications still need to get data for different components as components render.
  
* If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
  * Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route /> -> this will allow it to render on all pages regardless of a specified route.

* What does props.children contain?
 * Props.children is a special prop, automatically passed to every component that can be used to render the content included between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. 




## Vocabulary Terms

### Composition :
  * the act of combining parts or elements to form a whole.
### Children / Child Components :
  * components that are nested within a parent React component.
### Hash Routing :
  *  Using the anchor part of the URL to simulate different content.
### Link Routing :
  * Provides declarative, accessible navigation around the application.

* Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, allows you to add React state to function components.
* Hooks let us organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units
* Hooks apply the React philosophy (explicit data flow and composition) inside a component, rather than just between the components
* Hooks don’t introduce unnecessary nesting into your component tree. They also don’t suffer from the drawbacks of mixins
* Hooks let you always use functions instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props
* Hooks let you use React features (like state) from a function — by doing a single function call. React provides a few built-in Hooks exposing the “building blocks” of React: state, lifecycle, and context.
* Built-in React Hooks like useState and useEffect serve as the basic building blocks
* The only argument passed to the useState() Hook is the initial state, if you want to store two different values in state, you call useState() twice
useState() returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it
* Hooks are fully encapsulated — each time you call a Hook, it gets isolated local state within the currently executing component
* They’re not a way to share state — but a way to share stateful logic
* Each Hook may contain some local state and side effects. You can pass data between multiple Hooks just like you normally do between functions. They can take arguments and return values because they are JavaScript functions.
* Unlike render props or higher-order components, Hooks don’t create a “false hierarchy” in your render tree. They’re more like a flat list of “memory cells” attached to a component. No extra layers.
