# JQury 

* jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major
browsers and without any fallback code needed.
* jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

* The `• htm 1 ()` and `• text ()` methods both retrieve and update the content of elements.
*jQuery allows you to recreate the functionality of a loop on a selection of elements, using the
`• each ()` method.  
* The `• on ()` method is used to handle all events.
* The `.animate()` method allows you to create some of your own effects and animations by
  changing CSS properties.

 
## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
### How does pair programming work?

* While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
* The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
* Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
* The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
* The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
* The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

 
 ## Why pair program?

1. Greater efficiency : when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making.
2. Engaged collaboration : When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone.
3. Learning from fellow students : working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of.
4. Social skills : When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.
5. Job interview readiness .
6. Work environment readiness .
