## Tags
* `<%` 'Scriptlet' tag, for control-flow, no output.
* `<%_` ‘Whitespace Slurping’ Scriptlet tag, strips all whitespace before it.
* `<%=` Outputs the value into the template (HTML escaped).
* `<%-` Outputs the unescaped value into the template.
* `<%#` Comment tag, no execution, no output.
* `<%%` Outputs a literal `'<%'`.
* `%>` Plain ending tag.
* `-%>` Trim-mode ('newline slurp') tag, trims following newline.
* `_%>` ‘Whitespace Slurping’ ending tag, removes all whitespace after it.

## Working with volumes

* You can perform a volumes search by sending an HTTP GET request to the following URI: [ volumes ](https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=search+terms)

* This request has a single required parameter:
   - q - Search for volumes that contain this text string. 
   - There are special keywords you can specify in the search terms to search in particular fields, such as:
        - intitle: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the title.
        - inauthor: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the author.
        - inpublisher: Returns results where the text following this keyword is found in the publisher.
        - subject: Returns results where the text following this keyword is listed in the category list of - the volume.
        - isbn: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the ISBN number.
        - lccn: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the Library of Congress Control Number.
        - oclc: Returns results where the text following this keyword is the Online Computer Library Center number.
