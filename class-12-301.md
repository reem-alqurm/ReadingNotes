* Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views.
* In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters .
* Partials are templates that we can write, that we can include in other templates. For example our html boilerplate, we don’t want to include on every template, that’s not very DRY.
 * Partials are basically just views that are designed to be used from within other views.
