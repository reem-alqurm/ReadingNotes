* s a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP.

* It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. 
* A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.





# SuperAgent

* SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js! .

## Request basics
* A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling `.then()` (or `.end()` or `await`) to send the request.
* Old-style callbacks are also supported, but not recommended. Instead of `.then()` you can call `.end():`. 
* `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` requests can also be used,
* `DELETE` can be also called as `.del()` for compatibility with old IE where delete is a reserved word.

## GET requests

* The `.query()` method accepts objects, which when used with the GET method will form a query-string.
## Query strings
* `req.query(obj)` is a method which may be used to build up a query-string. For example populating `?format=json&dest=/login` on a `POST`.

## TLS options
* In Node.js SuperAgent supports methods to configure HTTPS requests:

* `.ca()` : Set the CA certificate(s) to trust.
* `.cert()` : Set the client certificate chain(s).
* `.key()` : Set the client private key(s).
* `.pfx()` : Set the client PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain.
* `.disableTLSCerts()` : Does not reject expired or invalid TLS certs.

## Parsing response bodies
* SuperAgent will parse known response-body data for you, currently supporting application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/json, and multipart/form-data.

## Aborting requests
* To abort requests simply invoke the `req.abort()` method.
## Authentication
* In both Node and browsers auth available via the `.auth()`

## Browser and node versions
* SuperAgent has two implementations: one for web browsers (using XHR) and one for Node.JS (using core http module). 
* By default Browserify and WebPack will pick the browser version.

* If want to use WebPack to compile code for Node.JS, you must specify node target in its configuration.
