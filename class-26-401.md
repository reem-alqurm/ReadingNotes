#  Component Based UI
## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
  * Angular, Vue, Ember, Svelte 3, Ext JS by Sencha

* What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
  * The technical difference lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library you are in charge of the flow of the application ( you are choosing when and where to call the library), but when you use a framework it is in charge of the flow (provides some places for you to plug in your code but it calls the code you plugged in as needed). 

## Vocabulary Terms

### Rendering :
* Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser.

### Templates :
* Templating refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language.


### State :
* Describes the status of the entire program or an individual object.




## JSX

* JSX produces React “elements”.
* React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

* React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.


* React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.
* It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
* You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. 
* After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
* If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with `/>`.
* JSX tags may contain children.
* ` React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object.


* An element describes what you want to see on the screen.
* React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create.
* Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node.
* To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to `ReactDOM.render()`.
* React elements are immutable : Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.
