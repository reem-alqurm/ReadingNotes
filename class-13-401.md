#  Message Queues
## Review, Research, and Discussion
* What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? Why is this useful?
  * to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services.

* Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
 * Yes,when websockets aren't supported.


* What happens when a client emits an event?
  * When a client emits, it sends the data and the server will receive it when the client connect



* What happens when a server emits an event?
  *  It will sends the data.



## Vocabulary Terms

### Socket :
* when twoprograms running it is the endpoint of this communication link.
### Web Socket :
* computer communications protocol between a client and a server.


### Socket.io :
* JavaScript library for realtime web applications.

### Client :
* a computer that connects to the network. 
### Server :
*  who receive and process the requests from the client.
### OSI Model :
* **Open Systems Interconnection Model** is a conceptual framework used to describe the functions of a networking system.
### TCP Model :
* It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The TCP/IP model is a concise version of the OSI model.
### TCP :
* Transmission Control Protocol.
### UDP :
* User Datagram Protocol.

## Message Queue?

* **A message queue** is a form of **asynchronous** service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.

* Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. 

* Each message is processed only once, by a **single consumer**.

* Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads.

## Rooms and Namespaces:

* A room is an arbitrary channel that sockets can join and leave. It can be used to broadcast events to a subset of clients.
*  rooms are a **server-only** concept.
* Each Socket in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier `Socket#id`.

* by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client.

* allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open.

* a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server.

* Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers. 
* It uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface, it is divided into two parts; `both WebSocket` vs `Socket.io` are **event-driven** libraries.
