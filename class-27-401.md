# Props and State
## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Does a deployed React application require a server?
  * Don't necessarily needed.
  
* Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
  * By testing behavior, you won't have to adjust after each minor code change. 

* What does npm run build do?
 * will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder.

* Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application
 *  React application is split into components, it is important that you can add functionality to a component without causing rippling changes through the codebase.

## Vocabulary Terms

### BDD :
  *  behavior driven development, a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD), which uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests.

### Acceptance Tests :
  *  testing technique performed to determine whether or not the software system has met the requirement specifications.


### mounting :
  * the operating system makes files and directories on a storage device available for users to access via the computer's file system.

### build:
  * process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer.


## setState

* Update to a component state should be done using `setState()` .
* Pass a function when you can to update state multiple times.

## Handling Events

* is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.
* the main defiriens is React events are named using camelCase rather than just lowercase, and with JSX you pass a function as the event handler rather than a string.
* you must call `preventDefault` explicitly.

## Forms
* HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
* In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState() not like the HTML bacis form.

## State and Lifecycle

* Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
* You can think of React lifecycle methods as the series of events that happen from the birth of a React component to its death.
* `setState()` in only these React lifecycle methods: `componentDidMount` , `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillReceiveProps` .

## Components and Props

* Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation
* Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
* Components can refer to other components in their output
* Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props
* All React components must act like pure functions (do not attempt to change their inputs and always return the same result for the same inputs) with respect to their props
