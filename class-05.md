# Images & Coloers & Text 

## Images 

* Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description.

* To add an image into the page you need to use an `<img>`element.

* it carry the following two attributes:
  - src :This tells the browser where it can find the image file. 
  - alt :This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.

* You will also often see an `<img>` element use two other attributes that specify its size:
  - height :This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
  - width :This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

* Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.

* `<figure>` element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.

## Color :

### Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions

* The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element.

* You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

  - rgb values : These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.
    For example: rgb(100,100,90).

  - hex codes : These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color,
    preceded by a pound or hash #sign. For example: #ee3e80.

  - color names : There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized
    by browsers. For example: DarkCyan.

 #### * Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

 #### * It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

 #### * CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

 #### * CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Text :

* The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into
two groups:
  - Those that directly affect the font and its appearance.
  - Those that would have the same effect on text no matter
    what font you were using.
* Typeface Terminology :

 - Serif : Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of
   the letters. These details are known as serifs.

 - Sans-Serif : Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters.

 - Monospace : Every letter in a monospace font is the same width.

 - Weight : The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect
   the amount of white space and contrast on a page.

 - Style : Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering. 

 - Stretch : In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are
   thinner and closer together. In expanded versions they are thicker and further apart.

* The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font.

* `@font-face` allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed
  on the computer of the person browsing.

* The font-weight property allows you to create bold text.
  There are two values that this property commonly takes:
  - normal : This causes text to appear at a normal weight.
  - bold : This causes text to appear bold.

* If you want to create italic text, you can use the font-style
  property. There are three values this property can take:
  - normal: This causes text to appear in a normal style.
  - italic: This causes text to appear italic.
  - oblique: This causes text to appear oblique.

* The text-transform property is used to change the case of text giving it
  one of the following values:
  - uppercase: This causes the text to appear uppercase.
  - lowercase: This causes the text to appear lowercase.
  - capitalize: This causes the first letter of each word to appear capitalized.

* The text-decoration property allows you to specify the following values:
  - none: This removes any decoration already applied to the text.
  - underline: This adds a line underneath the text.
  - overline: This adds a line over the top of the text.
  - line-through: This adds a line through words.
  - blink: This animates the text to make it flash on and off.

* Attribute Selectors:
